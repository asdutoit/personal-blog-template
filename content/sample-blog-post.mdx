The architecture consists of several key components:

```bash
# Example code block
kubectl get pods -n production
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
const config = {
  environment: "production",
  replicas: 3,
};
```

### Monitoring Setup

To ensure proper observability, we implement a comprehensive monitoring stack:
